Introduction
============

This tutorial demonstrates how to use ONETEP to relax the simulation cell of a
crystalline material


Cell relaxation of bulk crystalline silica
==========================================
 

This calculation will relax the lattice of a silica (SiO\ :sub:`2`) 
simulation cell, which is depicted below:

colored beige and the oxygen atoms are colored red.

Input file keywords
-------------------

The input file, which is provided, is called :code:`silica96.dat` and contains
96 atoms in total.

To perform cell relaxation the  

::

    task STRESS        

keyword is required. 

You will notice in the input file also the following keywords 
related to the cell relaxation:

::

    stress_tensor T
    stress_elasticity F
    stress_relax T
    stress_assumed_symmetry tetra1
    stress_relax_atoms T

Where :code:`stress_tensor T` instructs the code to compute the stress tensor,
while the calculation of elestic constants is trned off with 
:code:`stress_elasticity F`. 
In this calculation the simulation cell will be relaxed (in order to determine
the optimal lattice vectors) and this is denoted by :code:`stress_relax T`.
In this calculation, in addition to the simulation cell we want do relax also
the coordinates of the atoms and for this we use the keyword 
:code:`stress_relax_atoms T`. 
It is worth noting here that the atomic coordinates would also be relaxed if the 
:code:`stress_relax_atoms` was set to :code:`F` (False), but in this case they
would only be "stretched" to be commensurate with the change in the lattice 
vectors, in other words they would retain the same fractional coordinates. 
On the other hand if the :code:`stress_relax_atoms` is activated the coordinates
of the atoms are fully relaxed and are not comstrained to remain equal to the
fractional coordinates they had at the start of the calculation. 

Finally the :code:`stress_assumed_symmetry tetra1` instructs the code to assume
a particular symmetry for the simulation cell and maintain this symmetry during
the cell relaxation. 
Is the symmetry of the cell is known and is supported by the code (see the user
manual) is is important to activate it with this keyword as it will 
significantly reduce the number of single point energy calculations that will be
performed. 


Running the calculation
-----------------------

Now run the calculation and examine the output. 
Lets examine the output step by step noting the various stages of the
calculation.

At the very beginning some information about the initialisation of the 
calculation is produced such as:

- :code:`PSINC grid sizes`: information about the grids used for the psinc basis 
  functions
- :code:`Atom SCF Calculation for...`: here the code initialises the NGWFs with
  atomic orbitals created specificaly for the valence electrons of the chosen 
  pseudopotentials and confined within the NGWF spherical regions.  
- :code:`STRESS: undistorted cell`: this is the beginning of the very first 
  energy calculation from which calculations with applied stains will be 
  subtracted to compute the stress tensor.
- :code:`Atomic positions optimised prior to stress calculation`: a geometry 
  relaxation is performed first since we have specified
  :code:`stress_relax_atoms T`.

You will notice that this calculation takes 30 NGWF iterations to converge as a
very tight convergence criterion for the NGWFs 
(:code:`ngwf_threshold_orig 1.e-7`) has been applied in the input. 
This was done to ensure very accurate forces and it may be a bit extreme, but it
is better to be on the safe side.

After this energy evaluation the code computes the forces and compares them with
the threshold that has been defined for geoemetry relaxation.
In this calculation you will notice that the forces are small and below the
tolerance (:code:`|F|max 1.e-3 Eh/Bohr`) that has been set for the convergence
of the geometry.
As a result the code reports that the geoemetry relaxation has been completed 
with the message "Geometry optimization completed successfully".

Calculation of the stress tensor
--------------------------------

Then the calculation proceeds to evaluate the energy of the system at different
distortions (strains) of the lattice vectors in order to compute the stress 
tensor. 
The beginning of this procedure is denoted by the 
:code:`STRESS: distorted cells` message.

The stress tensor computed is summarised at the end of the first iteration of
cell relaxation:

::

    stress_tensor:  iteration   1

This stress tensor is now used to change the simulation cell.
Again a geometry relaxation is performed which converges at the first step.
Then several single point energy calculations follow to compute a new stress
tensor until we obtain the summary of the second iteration:

::

    stress_tensor:  iteration   2

Finally, we see that in the third iteration the cell has been relaxed. 
The relaxed cell is printed:
